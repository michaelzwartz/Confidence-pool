# Confidence-pool
This repository stores the results from the Zwartz family confidence pool for the 2022-2023 NFL Season. Also in this repository is the python code I wrote to determine the weekly winner, season winner, and various statistics for each participant. 

The pool_functions.py file has the basic data cleaning functions written out. 

The pool_notebook.ipynb is jupyter notebook file that I used to explore the data. It calls the functions from the python file. 
Also, the notebook explores the data further looking at upset predictions and how the group did as a whole. 

The Pool_stats_ntbk.ipynb is a space for me to experiment without ruining any other code.
